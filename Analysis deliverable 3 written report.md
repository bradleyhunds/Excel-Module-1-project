# Kickstarting with Excel


1. Overview
Louise would like to know how different kickstarter campaigns did in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We have been given a data set to organize and visualize to help Louise understand which campaigns did the best and why. Were some months better than others? Which types of kickstarters are more successful than others? We are trying to lay everything out in order to make an informed decision about how to give ourself the best chances of getting the desired outcome - Which in this case would be meeting our fundraising goal. 


2. Analysis and challenges
The first set of data that we extracted was "Outcomes Based on Launch date" We were able to visualize the number of succesful campaigns depending on the month it was launched. For Theater campaigns ONLY. This is to give us a better idea of Louise's play will do. The theater kickstarters are more relevant than the other types of kickstarters, but the overall picture is important too. 

Based on our analysis we could say that May and June launch dates have the highest chance for success, while December has the lowest chance of success. There were over twice as many successful campaigns in May as there were December. (See Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart)


The second set of data we looked at was Outcomes based on Goal. We used ranges to group the different campaigns based on their goal amount. 
Based on this chart we notice one main trend: As the goal amount goes up, the likelihood of its success goes down. The problem is that we do not have a very large sample size for the campaigns with a higher goal. The chart could be misleading.

When considering the goal amount for your campaign I would say that a lower goal means a higher chance of success, but lower goals are always easier to hit. The lines intersect at $15000. This to me represents the inflection point of where chances of failure are equal to your chances of success.

3. Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-May, June, and July campaigns have the highest chance of success for plays
-December campaigns have the lowest chance of success for the theater category

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-Higher goals have a lower chance of a successful outcome for theater campaigns

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-The sample size for larger goal amounts is incredibly low. It is hard to predict the outcome of campaigns with higher goals, because we hardly have any data points. If you were to look at the chart without knowing that, you may think high goal amounts have a high chance of success

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-I think it could be beneficial to make a chart to visualize the average donation per campaign filtered by Country. Maybe you would have a much higher chance of success launching your play campaign in another country depending on the circumstances
